    <h2 id="what-superhero-do">What makes a superhero?</h2>
    <p>
      A superhero is a person w does heroic deeds and has the ability to do them
      in a way that a normal person couldn't. So in order to be a superhero, <b>you need
      a power that is more exceptional than any power a normal human being could possess,</b>
      and you need to use that power to accomplish good deeds.<br>
      <br>Otherwise, a policeman or a fireman could be considered a superhero. For instance,
      a good guy fighting a bad guy could be just a regular police story or detective story
      or human-interest story. But if it’s a good guy with a superpower who is fighting a bad guy,
      it becomes a superhero story. If the good guy is doing something that a normal human being
      couldn’t do, couldn’t accomplish, then I assume he becomes a superhero.<br><br>

      After witnessing the murder of his parents Dr. Thomas Wayne and Martha Wayne, he swore vengeance
      against criminals, an oath tempered by a sense of justice. Bruce trains himself physically and
      intellectually and crafts a bat-inspired persona to fight crime.
